1. Main Monitor Only
This program is designed to work only on your main monitor. If you are using a multi-monitor setup, please ensure that the game is running on the primary display for the program to function correctly.

3. Windows Defender:
The script disables the "Generic PnP Monitor" driver, which may cause the executable to be detected by Windows Defender. To avoid this, please whitelist the program in your antivirus settings.

Usage:
1. Launch "Valorant".

2. In the settings, set the "Display Mode" to "Windowed Full Screen" and the "Aspect Ratio Method" to "Fill".

3. Run "True-Stretched.exe".
